Significant credit goes to the author of Press C to Crawl for the Stumble effect. The use of a
decaying block was the simplest method I could come across, and although I looked at other mods,
none inspired me nor were license compatible.

I spent a lot of time attempting to get the Beehemoth to be player fly-able and finally game up.
I was attempting to reference some of the Hippogryph code from Ice & Fire, but couldn't properly
understand it -- a lot of it was just adapted from 1.12.

He actively encouraged me to use the code from the Endergrade from Alex's Mobs instead, which is
also license compatible.
